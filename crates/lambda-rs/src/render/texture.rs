//! High‑level texture and sampler scaffolding.
//!
//! This module will expose `TextureBuilder`, `SamplerBuilder`, and supporting
//! enums/types as stable, `wgpu`-agnostic wrappers that delegate to the
//! platform layer. It is intentionally empty in Milestone 0 and will be
//! incrementally filled in later milestones per the textures/samplers spec.
