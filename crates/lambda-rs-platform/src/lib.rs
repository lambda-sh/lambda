//! Crossâ€‘platform abstractions and utilities used by Lambda.
//!
//! This crate hosts thin wrappers around `winit` (windowing) and `wgpu`
//! (graphics) that provide consistent defaults and ergonomic builders, along
//! with shader compilation backends and small helper modules (e.g., OBJ
//! loading and random number generation).
