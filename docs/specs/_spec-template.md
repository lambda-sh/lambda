# <Specification Title>

Summary
- State the problem and the desired outcome in one paragraph.
- Include a concise rationale for introducing or changing behavior.

## Scope

- Goals
  - List concrete, testable goals.
- Non-Goals
  - List items explicitly out of scope.

## Terminology

- Define domain terms and acronyms on first use (for example, uniform buffer
  object (UBO)). Use the acronym thereafter.

## Architecture Overview

- Describe components, data flow, and boundaries with existing modules.
- Include a small ASCII diagram if it materially aids understanding.

## Design

- API Surface
  - Enumerate public types, builders, functions, and commands.
  - Use code identifiers with backticks (for example, `RenderCommand`).
- Behavior
  - Specify observable behavior, constraints, and edge cases.
  - Use normative language (MUST/SHOULD/MAY) where appropriate.
- Validation and Errors
  - Document validation rules and the layer that enforces them.
  - Describe error conditions and error types.

## Constraints and Rules

- Platform and device limits that apply (for example, alignments, size caps).
- Data layout or serialization rules, if any.

## Performance Considerations

- Recommendations
  - State performance guidance succinctly.
  - Rationale: Provide a short reason for each recommendation.

## Requirements Checklist

- Functionality
  - [ ] Feature flags defined (if applicable)
  - [ ] Core behavior implemented
  - [ ] Edge cases handled (list)
- API Surface
  - [ ] Public types and builders implemented
  - [ ] Commands/entry points exposed
  - [ ] Backwards compatibility assessed
- Validation and Errors
  - [ ] Input validation implemented
  - [ ] Device/limit checks implemented
  - [ ] Error reporting specified and implemented
- Performance
  - [ ] Critical paths profiled or reasoned
  - [ ] Memory usage characterized
  - [ ] Recommendations documented
- Documentation and Examples
  - [ ] User-facing docs updated
  - [ ] Minimal example(s) added/updated
  - [ ] Migration notes (if applicable)

For each checked item, include a reference to a commit, pull request, or file
path that demonstrates the implementation.

## Verification and Testing

- Unit Tests
  - Describe coverage targets and representative cases.
  - Commands: `cargo test -p <crate> -- --nocapture`
- Integration Tests
  - Describe scenarios and expected outputs.
  - Commands: `cargo test --workspace`
- Manual Checks (if necessary)
  - Short, deterministic steps to validate behavior.

## Compatibility and Migration

- Enumerate breaking changes and migration steps, or state “None”.
- Note interactions with feature flags or environment variables.

## Changelog

- <YYYY-MM-DD> (v0.1.0) — Initial draft.
