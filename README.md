# game-engine

## Description
This repo is for learning how to structure and make a game engine! This entire
repository couldn't have been created without the help of The Cherno's series on
making a game engine. If you'd like to learn more about the awesome series,
please check out the link to his channel & series down below.

## Goals
- [ ] Create a game engine.
- [ ] Learn more about C++
- [ ] Make a game of my own(?)

## How to run/setup
In order to get external dependencies that are needed in order to run the project,
please run:
```
./setup.sh
```
This will initialize pre commit checks for development and also initialize all
git submodules.


In order to build and run a release build of the project, utilize:
```bash
./compile_and_run.sh Release
```
In order to build and run a debug build of the project, utilize:
```bash
./compile_and_run.sh Debug
```

## Live deployments
This project may or may not be used in games, but will definitely be used to create
my own unique rendering engine in the future.

## How to contribute
Fork the current repository and then make the changes that you'd like to said fork. Upon adding features, fixing bugs,
or whatever modifications you've made to the project, issue a pull request to this repository containing the changes that you've made

my schedule, and any other variable factors.
